# Water Pumps Automation Project

This repository contains several implementations for automating the control of water pumps in a reservoir. The goal is to ensure optimal pump operation through different programming techniques and platforms.

## Implementations

This project includes the following versions:

- **STEP7 Graph Program:** A sequential control system using Siemens STEP7:
