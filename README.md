# Water Pumps Automation Project

This repository contains several implementations for automating the control of water pumps in a reservoir. The goal is to ensure optimal pump operation through different programming techniques and platforms.

## Implementations

This project includes the following versions:

- **STEP7 Graph Program:** A sequential control system using Siemens STEP7.
- **STEP7 Ladder Program:** Ladder logic for Siemens PLC systems.
- **PIC16F877A Assembly Program:** An assembly program for controlling the water pumps using the PIC16F877A microcontroller.
- **Proteus Simulation:** A complete simulation of the assembly program using PROTEUS.
